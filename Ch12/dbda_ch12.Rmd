## Bayesian testing

Two approaches:

* Use highest-density interval
    + Define 'region of practical equivalence' (ROPE) around null value
    + Check whether HDI overlaps with ROPE  
    
* Hierarchical model comparison
    + Compare model with 'spike' prior on null value to model with uninformative 
    prior


## Bayesian testing caution

* ROPE limits are up to the analyst

* Because MCMC is nondeterminstic, the endpoints of HDIs are random, so an HDI 
that is very near a ROPE could under a different seed be on the other side.

* For model comparison approach, "it must be theoretically meaningful for the 
parameter value to be exactly the null value. "
